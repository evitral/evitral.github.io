I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at University of Nevada Reno, Mechanical Engineering Department, working in Prof. [James Hanna's group](https://cmag.neocities.org/index.html). We are interested in bending energies for plates and shells, and have worked on deriving them from the reduction of a quadratic-stretch 3D elasticity theory. We are also investigating pattern formation and crumple dynamics on curved elastic sheets.

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, University of Minnesota, supervised by Profs. [Perry H. Leo](https://cse.umn.edu/aem/perry-h-leo) and [Jorge Viñals](https://cse.umn.edu/physics/jorge-vinals). We worked on developing models for smectic-isotropic systems, which were implemented numerically and compared to analytic predictions based on asymptotic analysis (using tools such as differential geometry, and singular perturbation theory). We also investigated the role of azimuthal flows in the Spiral Defect Chaos regime that appears in Rayleigh-Bénard convection, an example of active smectic.

My **research interests** lie in mechanics of materials and soft matter, including:

* Continuum mechanics: nonlinear elasticity and fluids
* Interplay between mechanics, geometry, and pattern formation
* Crumpling and wrinkling in soft materials
* Motion and interaction of topological defects
* Phase-field modeling, including flows and non-classical stresses
