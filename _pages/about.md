I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, University of Minnesota, supervised by Profs. [Perry H. Leo](https://cse.umn.edu/aem/perry-h-leo) and [Jorge Viñals](https://www.physics.umn.edu/people/vinals.html). We work on developing models for smectic-isotropic systems, which are implemented numerically and compared to analytic predictions based on asymptotic analysis (using tools such as differential geometry, and singular perturbation theory). We also investigate the role of azimuthal flows in the Spiral Defect Chaos regime that appears in Rayleigh-Bénard convection, an example of active smectic.

I will be joining Prof. [James Hanna's group](https://cmag.neocities.org/index.html) at University of Nevada Reno as a postdoc, in Fall&#160;2020.

My research interests lie in mechanics of materials and soft matter, including:

* Continuum mechanical description of soft materials
* Interplay between mechanics, geometry, and pattern formation
* Motion and interaction of topological defects
* Phase-field modeling, including flows and non-classical stresses
