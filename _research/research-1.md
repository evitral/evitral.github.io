title: "Phase-field modeling of smectic-isotropic systems"
excerpt: "Sintering of smectic thin films may lead to morphological transitions from focal conics to conical pyramids and other suprising patterns. We develop smectic-isotropic phase-field models, including flows and non-classical stresses, in order to study the evolution of these interfaces. Using an amplitude equation formalism, analytic interface equations (Gibbs-Thomson, velocity) are derived, evidencing the role of the Gaussian curvature and layer orientation on the observed patterns. <br/><img src='/images/cpyr.png'>"
