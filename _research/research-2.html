title: "Spiral Defect Chaos in Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection"
excerpt: "Rotating spirals are shown to induce azimuthal flows, which are function of a spiral's topological charge and frequency of rotation. We investigate how neighboring spirals may interact through such flows, and suggest a correlation between a balance of advection and unwinding of spirals, and the existence of the spiral chaos regime.  <br/><img src='/images/sdc.png'>"
